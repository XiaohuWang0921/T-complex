Theory of T-complexes
=====================
This repository contains a $\LaTeX$ file as well as its compiled PDF documenting the theory of so-called T-complexes that I have been developing for the past few years. I have decided to put it here mainly for three reasons:
* For backup in the rare (but possible) event that I lose my local copy.
* So that I may show others my work more easily.
* As I am already showing my work to others anyway, the concern rises that someone might decide to take credit for them before I do (perhaps not those to whom I showed my work directly, which mainly consist of my friends, but they might show it to others. Or am I just being paranoid?). In the unlikely case that this happens, maybe the history of this repository could serve as evidence that I came up with it first?

### Current WIP
- [ ] Show that the category `TComp` of T-complexes has all (small) coproducts, products and equalizers, and hence also all (small) limits.
- [ ] Show that `TComp` is a cartesian closed category (CCC).
